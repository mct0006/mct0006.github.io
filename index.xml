As we didn&amp;rsquo;t currently have an sftp server, we needed to get one set up.
In theory this seemed like an easy problem to solve, but it turned into quite a saga. Part of the difficulties were due to my own misunderstanding of the infrastructure on the side of the data owner; I made assumptions without fully fleshing out the details beforehand.</description></item></channel></rss>
